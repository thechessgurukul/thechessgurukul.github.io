    <h1>The Great Journey of Chess: From Ancient India to Your Board! 🇮🇳</h1>

    <div class="content">
        <p>Have you ever looked at your chess pieces and wondered where they came from? They didn't just appear out of thin air! Before there were video games or tablets, there was a magical game born right here in India that conquered the whole world.</p>

        <h3>📜 It Started with a Game Called Chaturanga</h3>
        <p>Long, long ago, in the royal palaces of India, wise people created a game called <strong>Chaturanga</strong>. In Sanskrit, it means "four parts." Back then, the game was a way for Kings to learn how to protect their kingdom.</p>
        
        <p>Instead of the pieces we know today, the board was filled with a real ancient army: the Chariots (Rooks), the Mighty Elephants (Bishops), the Brave Horses (Knights), and the Foot Soldiers (Pawns).</p>

        <h3>🌍 The Game Begins to Travel</h3>
        <p>First, travelers took the game to Persia. The Persians loved it! They started calling the King the "Shah." When the King was trapped, they would shout <strong>"Shah Mat!"</strong> That is where our word <strong>"Checkmate"</strong> comes from! It means "The King is finished."</p>

        <h3>👑 A Quick "Upgrade" in Europe</h3>
        <p>As the game moved to Europe, the pieces changed to match the times. The Elephants turned into Bishops, and the Chariots became Rooks. But the biggest change happened to the <strong>Queen</strong>. She used to be very slow, moving only one square. Around 500 years ago, she was given "superpowers," making her the most powerful piece on the board!</p>

        <h3>🏆 Chess Today: You are Part of History!</h3>
        <p>Today, chess is played in every country on Earth. The best part? Even though the pieces look a little different and the Queen is much faster now, the spirit of the game is exactly the same as it was in ancient India.</p>

        <p><strong>It is still about being patient, thinking ahead, and solving puzzles. When you sit down to play a match, you aren't just playing a game—you are walking in the footsteps of Kings and ancient warriors.</strong></p>

        <div class="fun-fact-box">
            <strong>💡 Fun Fact for Young Masters:</strong><br>
            Did you know? The very first chess boards weren't black and white! They were often just one solid color. The "checkered" pattern was added much later to help players see where their pieces could move more easily. 🏁

            Question for you: If you could create a new chess piece, what would it be called and how would it move? Tell your coach in your next class!
